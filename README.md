# Building-a-ChatBot
Chatbot is a computer program that stimulates a natural human conversation.Users communicate with the chatbot via the chat interface or by voice,like how they would talk to a real person.
Chatbots interpret and process usersâ€™ words or phrases and give an instant pre-set answer.
Eliza , Parry , A.L.I.C.E , Siri , Google Assistant , Cortana , Amazon Alexa etc are the different types of ChatBot.



Here we are building a simple ChatBot.




The intents (2).json file contains the intents(i.e tags,patterns and responses).
When the user types his/her message to the ChatBot , the Bot interprtet and processes the patterns and accordingly gives the responses for that pattern.
